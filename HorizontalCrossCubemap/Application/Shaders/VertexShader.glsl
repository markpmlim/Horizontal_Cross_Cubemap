 No geometry are passed to this vertex shader; the range of gl_VertexID: [0, 2]
 The position and texture coordinates attributes of 3 vertices are
 generated on the fly.
 position: (-1.0, -1.0), (3.0, -1.0), (-1.0, 3.0)
       uv: ( 0.0,  0.0), (2.0,  0.0), ( 0.0, 2.0)
 The area of the generated triangle covers the entire clip space.
 Note: any geometry rendered outside this 2D space is clipped.
 Clip space:
 Range of position: [-1.0, 1.0] both horizontally and vertically.
 Range of       uv: [ 0.0, 1.0] both horizontally and vertically.
 The origin of the uv axes starts at the bottom left corner of the
 2D NDC space with u-axis from left to right and
 v-axis from bottom to top.
 For the mathematically-inclined, the line y = -x + 3 is the hypotenuse of a
  right-angled triangle. The other 2 lines are x = -1.0 and y = -1.0.
 The points (3.0, -1.0) and (-1.0, 3.0) lie on the sloping line.
 The last point (-1.0, -1.0) lie on x = -1.0 and y = -1.0.
